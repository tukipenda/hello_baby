Should I have a status update saved regularly to check on progress?

status would include:
time, PIP, PEEP, POP, suction, FiO2, flow, 
heat_on, heat_mode, mask_type,
ventilation type, ventilation rate

what about a timeline?
when was PPV started, when was heat set to baby_mode, etc..., when did key events occur?

should add a score for the outcome of the scenario - will have to handle a little bit differently, not based on checks, 
but based on numbers, give a percentage based on health of heart/lungs.  

could add surfactant to the scenario

I think I may need to include transwarmer, plastic bag for a GA 32 week infant?
