Now you need to fetch your supplies.
When you are ready, click here top deliver the baby.
Your baby was delivered, don't forget to start the timer.
Your baby isn't breathing - click actions to start helping the baby breathe.
First dry, stimulate, and suction.
Oops, the baby still isn't breathing, let's start PPV.
Now that we are giving PPV, you can see that the baby's chest is rising.
Lets place the pulse ox.
We can place the temp probe too, put on a hat, switch to baby mode.

Congratulations, you saved the baby!
Uh oh, the baby's heart is less than 60 bpm.  Scenario failed?
