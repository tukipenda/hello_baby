Dashboard: 
Resp mode - if giving breaths (how frequently) (can make a video later)
CPR - if given compressions how frequently/how deep (can make a video later)
medications - UVC in place, meds given w/ timing (later can add a time-keeper).
supplies at bedside

Interventions - adjust warmer, get supplies, simple actions (dry/stim), adjust ventilation, adjust CPR, procedures, give meds

Actions - review history, adjust warmer, vent (start PPV or intubate), start cpr, place UVC (give meds), supplies, simple actions (dry, stim, suction).
hx/warmer/vent/cpr (left) procedures/meds/simple actions/supplies (right) - overlay with modal window?



Feedback - correct interventions?  At the right time?
Notes for teaching - review different parts of NRP

How to make the game/simulation interesting and tricky (can I find some comparison games)
Give a grade - score for percentage correct

supplies - some are available, some are not (which ones do you really need)
Have certain ones available (at random), ask if there are others that you need

actions - how do I keep people from just doing the same actions every time automatically
Need to have a few different scenarios, some with the right actions, some with the wrong actions

Need to trial the game with different people and get feedback

Interface needs to be really obvious
Need to make it clear that you can't use certain things during the tutorial
