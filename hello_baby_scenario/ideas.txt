Game Mechanics:
Respiratory efficacy - needs to incorporate both FiO2 and quality of ventilation.  
FiO2 (21% or greater than that)
Pressures - PEEP too low (may have trouble with oxygenation due to closing alveoli)
PEEP too high - may not have enough delta P
PIP too high (risk of pneumo), PIP too low not enough delta P (may be easier to look at PIP-PEEP separately)
mouth open or closed (if closed, poor efficacy)
air leak or not (air leak will reduce efficacy)
Then also need to take into account whether infant can breathe spontaneously
High secretions - poor efficacy, low secretions good efficacy

Basically - mouth closed, air leak, secretions, low PEEP reduce efficacy
if PIP-PEEP too low -> no chest rise
FiO2 increased -> increases efficacy (if not 100%) (but by how much?)

#at some point will want to incorporate possibility of a pneumothorax, but not yet -> maybe if PIP too high -> can just send message - your infant had a pneumothorax, you lose?


Circulation:
need to incorporate ideas of UVC (with fluid volume), effect of epi, effect of CPR
