set resp rate, compressions rate
heart rate increasing

Actions affect infant.

Scenario - baby PE, vitals, ventilation status, CPR status, UVC status, medications given, tasks completed
update function -> all of the logic (inputs - time, actions, baby's status)

ventilation type - bag/mask vs ett, rate, PIP/PEEP/POP, FiO2, efficacy level?, 
bag mask ventilation - mouth open?, seal?, secretions, positioning
ett - tube size, tube placement (deep or shallow?),
